# Project Name

This project contains the following files:

- `server.cpp`: This file contains the code for the server application.
- `client.cpp`: This file contains the code for the first client application.
- `client2.cpp`: This file contains the code for the second client application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the server application using the following command:
    ```
    g++ server.cpp -o server
    ```
3. Compile the client applications using the following commands:
    ```
    g++ client.cpp -o client
    g++ client2.cpp -o client2
    ```
4. Run the server application using the following command:
    ```
    ./server
    ```
   **Caution:** Make sure to run the server application before running the client applications.

5. Run the client applications in separate terminals using the following commands:
    ```
    ./client
    ./client2
    ```

## Usage

Once the server and client applications are running, you can use them to perform various tasks. Please refer to the code documentation in each file for more information.

## Multithreading

The server application is planned to be implemented with multithreading to handle multiple client connections simultaneously. This will improve the performance and scalability of the application.

## Future Development

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a file transfer application using sockets. This project serves as a learning progress towards achieving that goal.
